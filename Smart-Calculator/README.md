# Smart-Calculator-Implementation

## Welcome

This repository was forked from the Smart Calculator Lab repository, for the [RES course](https://github.com/wasadigi/Teaching-HEIGVD-RES) taught at the HEIG-VD.

In this lab we will implement our version of the discovery protocol (https://github.com/SimoneRighitto/Smart-Calculator/blob/master/implementation/DiscoveryComputingEngines.md)
